# App Outlet API
This application is the Rest API that provides data to the App Outlet website. It also synchronizes data from application stores and stores it on App Outlet database.

## Setting up the project
We are developing the second version of the App Outlet API using Kotlin as the primary language and uses the Spring boot framework. We also decided to use Gradle as a build tool.

The easiest way to set up the project is using the IntelliJ IDEA to do it.

1. Download and install the Java Development Kit 11.
    - You can download it from the [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
    - You can use the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) or [Correto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/) instead of the Oracle implementation.
1. Download IntelliJ IDEA from [JetBrains download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
    - You can use the community edition that is free and open source
1. Open or import the application to IntelliJ IDEA
    - You can open the folder or open the `build.gradle.kts` file as a project
